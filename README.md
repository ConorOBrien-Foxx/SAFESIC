# SAFESIC
## A safe language for a safe age.

## Introduction

Over the past few years, the world has been thrown into chaos by the sudden revelation for the need for *safety*. Everything is unsafe, and so much depends on things being safe. This also applies to programming languages, oddly enough.

If a language isn't safe, why bother? Is my JavaScript safe? What about my Python?

Enter: SAFESIC, a 𝓈𝒶𝒻ℯ language.

SAFESIC, or **S**afe **A**lternative **F**or **E**legant, **S**imple **I**ntermediate **C**omputations, is a simple, safe language. It foregoes the need for unsafe memory allocations in favor of a simpler, register-based paradigm.
